# google-photos-organizer
Update metadata of the google photos files so it contains descriptions, locations and the correct dates.


## Set up
### Environment Vars
This file will contain path info.

The `takeoutPrefix` is the path to the folder containing the zipped Takeout files from a multi-file google photos export. This choice was made because usually people require this service because their cloud storage is full and they want to host their own cloud storage using the metadata from google photos.
